## Unit of Work Pattern Implementation

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of the Unit of Work pattern, applied in business logic and database interactions. The code provided is intended for educational purposes and contains known limitations. It is not recommended for production use.

#### Key Concepts in This Example

1. Unit of Work

   - The Unit of Work component is responsible for managing transactions and tracking changes in models.
   - It ensures that all operations within a business transaction are either fully executed or, in case of failure, none are executed.
   - The Unit of Work maintains its own copy of the mapper registry and tracks lists of new, modified, and removed objects.
   - At the end of the transaction, it processes these lists to execute all necessary database operations in a single transaction.

2. Data Mapper

   - A mock implementation of a data mapper interface is provided to demonstrate the interaction with methods like insert, update, and delete. This shows how the Unit of Work interacts with the data mappers.
   - The Data Mapper is responsible for transferring data between the application and the database, abstracting the underlying database interactions from the application’s core logic.

3. Anemic Domain Models

   - We use Python’s dataclasses to define domain models, such as Post and Comment, representing domain entities with their data and state management methods.
   - These models are referred to as anemic because they lack business logic, which is instead handled by services or use-case layers.

4. Business Logic and Database Gateway

   - The business logic example includes creating, saving, and deleting posts and comments. This logic is encapsulated in a service or gateway, which coordinates the operations between domain models and data mappers.
   - The Database Gateway uses the Unit of Work and data mappers to perform operations on posts and comments in a transactional way, ensuring data integrity.

### Integration with Clean Architecture

This implementation follows Clean Architecture principles, as described by Robert C. Martin. The business logic is separated from infrastructure concerns, allowing for modularity, easier testing, and better maintainability.

#### Key Principles Applied:

1. Separation of Business Logic from Infrastructure: The business logic (e.g., managing posts and comments) is decoupled from database operations, which are handled by the Data Mapper and Unit of Work.
2. Centralization of Business Rules: The core domain logic is encapsulated within its own use-case layer, making it easier to test and maintain.
3. Inward Dependency Rule: Interactions between layers are structured so that higher-level components (business logic) do not depend on low-level details (database implementation).

The Unit of Work pattern aligns with the approach described in Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture by Martin Fowler, where it is used to manage transactions and coordinate data modifications efficiently.
